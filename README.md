This synth which I've called 'elements', builds on a number of other electronic projects that I have published on Instructables. The synth is based around a pulse width modulated (PWM) oscillator routed through a resonant low pass filter. There are a number of ways to control the 'growling' tonality of this synth, either through a couple of light dependent resistors (LDR's) or through LED control via a couple vactrol's (LED and LDR connected together).


But that's not all! There are a bunch of other potentiometers to control cutoff, speed, modulation, and resonance .


The front panel is actually a PCB which you can easily get printed up by a PCB manufacturer. I designed it so it fits perfectly over the board giving the synth a really great finish.


Oh and I forgot to mention that I also included CV and gate outputs so you can hook it up to a sequencer or other synths.


All this means that this synth is a blast to play around with.


I've kept everything as simple as possible on this build so anyone who can solder will be able to make it. I've done away with a case and fancy power supplies to keep the build easy.


I'll be doing a series of 'little synths with big sounds' builds like this so keep an eye out for them.


I had a few goals when building this synth. It had to be fun to play, be able to connect to external inputs like a sequencer and to keep it as simple as possible!
